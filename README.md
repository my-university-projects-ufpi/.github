# 🎓 University Projects

This organization was created to **centralize, organize, and version my academic projects**, developed throughout my undergraduate studies in **Computer Science at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI)**.

Here you will find repositories related to:
- University assignments  
- Course projects  
- Directed studies and experiments  
- Proofs of concept (PoCs)  
- Academic simulations, APIs, front-end and back-end projects  

All projects were developed with a strong focus on **learning, best practices, and technical growth**, ranging from simple implementations to more structured and complete solutions.
